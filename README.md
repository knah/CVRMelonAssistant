ChilloutVR Melon Assistant boasts a rich feature set, some of which include:
* Installed mod detection
* Mod uninstallation

## Usage
Download the newest build from the release section and run it. This application auto-updates when launched, there is no need to download a new release each time.

## Themes
ChilloutVR Melon Assistant should support themes for Mod Assistant. Check [its README](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant#themes) for more info on theming.
However, this is not a supported feature. If something doesn't work, don't complain to either Assistant or knah.

## Common Issues
**I hit install but I don't see anything in game!**
  Double check that you followed the [Usage](#usage) instructions correctly.
  Make sure you're looking in the right place. Sometimes mod menus move as modding libraries/practices change.
  Additionally, make sure the proper ChilloutVR installation directory is selected in option tab.

**I don't see a certain mod in the mods list!**
  ChilloutVR Melon Assistant uses mods from ChilloutVR Modding Group and shows whatever is available for download.
  You can ask mod author to submit their mod for review to be included in the list.

**I hit install but now my game won't launch, I can't click any buttons, I only see a black screen, etc**
